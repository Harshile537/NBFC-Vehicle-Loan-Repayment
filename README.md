# NBFC-Vehicle-Loan-Repayment

Project 2: NBFI Vehicle Loan repayment Dataset  
Problem Statement  
A non-banking financial institution (NBFI) or non-bank financial company (NBFC) is a type of 
financial institution that is not authorized to operate as a bank or is not under the supervision of a 
banking regulatory agency at the national or international level. NBFCs provide financial services 
similar to those of banks, such as investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market 
brokering. 
An NBFC is currently facing profitability issues due to an increase in defaults in the vehicle loan 
category. The company aims to assess the loan repayment ability of clients and determine the 
relative importance of each factor contributing to a borrower's ability to repay the loan. 
The objective is to predict whether a client is likely to default on their vehicle loan payment or not. 
The task involves building a model using the Train_Dataset and testing the model on the 
Test_Dataset. The predictions for each ID in the Test_Dataset are to be submitted to the 
Hackathon platform.   
Approach:  
Step1: Develop Problem Statement.  
Step2: Perform the EDA and ready the data as per the need of the kind of machine learning 
algorithm you are going to apply.  
Step3: Train and Test the Machine Learning Algorithms.  
Step4: Evaluate the Machine Learning model. (Iterate if necessary) 
Step5: Develop a streamlit application.   
Step6: Push the code on Github with the appropriate Readme.md file.
